Cinema Room REST Service
Always wanted to have your private movie theater and screen only the movies you like? 
You can buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets? 
Having a booth is old-fashioned, so let's create a special service for that! Make good 
use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats, sell and 
refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue. Pass me the popcorn, please!
